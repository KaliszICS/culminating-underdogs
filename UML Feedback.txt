Missing dividers in UML between class, variables and methods.
Missing composition arrows when using a class in another class variable
getStatus returns a Status but there is no Status class.
WordleGame class using composition with almost every class and is missing these arrows.
There is no inheritance or implementation in your program and it looks like no polymorphism.
Some classes seem to do only one method with no information and should probably just be a static class instead of an object.
